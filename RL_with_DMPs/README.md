## Dexterous Manipulation Strategies using REPS and DMPs

To demonstrate the dexterity of the delta robots by manipulating certain objects, we formulate the problem as a trajectory generation problem using reinforcement learning and use DMPs to generate the trajectories using simulation (IsaacGym) and real hardware (our Delta Array :D).
