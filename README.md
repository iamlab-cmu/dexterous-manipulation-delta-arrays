# Dexterous Manipulation using Delta Arrays

Dexterous manipulation strategies implemented on the Delta Arrays using various implementations.
* Model Free Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Motion Primitives
* Open Loop Motion and Contact Planning Algorithm - HiDex
* Closed Loop Visual Feedback with Causal Inference and Probabilistic Graphical Models for Planar Manipulation 
* Dexterous Distributed Manipulation using SAC and Multi-Agent RL
* (new) A Diffusion-based Policy to generate object trajectories. 

This is a research project to aid development of modular sample-efficient dexterous manipulation algorithms that are benchmarked with an array of 64 Delta Robots in an 8x8 grid.
