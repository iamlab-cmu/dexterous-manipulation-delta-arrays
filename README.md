# Dexterous Manipulation using Delta Arrays

Dexterous manipulation strategies implemented on the Delta Arrays using various implementations.
* Model Free Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Motion Primitives
* Open Loop Motion and Contact Planning Algorithm - HiDex
* Closed Loop Visual Feedback with Causal Inference and Probabilistic Graphical Models for Planar Manipulation 

This is a research project to aid development of dexterous manipulation algorithms, multi-agent co-operative robots, and sample-efficient learning frameworks.
